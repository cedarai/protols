# Special Thanks

This project is derived from [bufbuild/protocompile](https://github.com/bufbuild/protocompile) and [jhump/protoreflect](https://github.com/jhump/protoreflect). Thanks to the buf developers for their fantastic work.

Many of the components of [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls) are used to build the language server. A fork of golang/tools is maintained [here](https://github.com/kralicky/tools).
