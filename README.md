# Installing

1. Clone this repo
2. Build and install the protols binary: `go install ./cmd/protols`
3. Install `vsce` if you don't have it: `npm install --global @vscode/vsce`
4. cd to editors/vscode, then run `vsce package`
5. Install the vsix plugin: `code --install-extension ./protols-vscode-<version>.vsix`

# Special Thanks

This project is derived from [bufbuild/protocompile](https://github.com/bufbuild/protocompile) and [jhump/protoreflect](https://github.com/jhump/protoreflect). Thanks to the buf developers for their fantastic work.

Several packages in https://github.com/golang/tools are used to build the language server. A minimal subset of its lsp-related packages are maintained as a library at https://github.com/kralicky/tools-lite.
