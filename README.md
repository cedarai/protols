# Installing

1. Clone this repo
2. Clone submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Build and install the protols binary: `go install ./cmd/protols`
4. Install `vsce` if you don't have it: `npm install --global @vscode/vsce`
5. cd to editors/vscode, then run `vsce package`
6. Install the vsix plugin: `code --install-extension ./protols-vscode-<version>.vsix`
   * Note: you may need to change the vscode language association for ".proto" files to `protobuf`, if it is currently set to `proto`.

# Special Thanks

This project is derived from [bufbuild/protocompile](https://github.com/bufbuild/protocompile) and [jhump/protoreflect](https://github.com/jhump/protoreflect). Thanks to the buf developers for their fantastic work.

Many of the components of [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls) are used to build the language server. A fork of golang/tools is maintained [here](https://github.com/kralicky/tools).
